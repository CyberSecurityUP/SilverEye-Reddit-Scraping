# SilverEye-Reddit-Scrapping

A tool created to scrape reddit's using its own API

URL Reddit API: https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/

Silvereye is a program that I developed that very morning, while I couldn't sleep. The goal is to collect reddits based on a specific hashtag. The goal is to collect criminal posts and carry out monitoring in a simpler and easier way. I use Reddit's own API and there are some limitations, I tried to do a direct scraping, but I didn't have the patience and good results.

I intend to improve even more and add collections from Reddit, 4Chans, Telegram and even Discord in some way. The focus is on monitoring more crimes, whether threats of violence in schools, child abuse content and even crimes related to human trafficking.
